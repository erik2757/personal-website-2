              How much do you bench? Is a common gym term you will hear.
              Luckily, I can say I am proud of my answer now. I love hitting the
              gym as often as I can. I started working out my senior year in
              high school and havenâ€™t stopped since! 8 years later I still have
              the same commitment as day one! Growing up with a skinny frame, I
              always wanted to put on some muscle. I had a coworker from my
              first job introduce me to the foundations of bodybuilding. Thatâ€™s
              all I needed to spark the fire in me. Fast-forward, it became a
              part of my daily routine. Goals and routines might change but the
              commitment will always be there. In the gym you can find me doing
              strength training, body building, and most recently, cardio.

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <div class="ps5">
              <img src="ps5.jpeg" />Starting out having a Nintendo64 as my first
              console, to now owning a PS5, I can say gaming has a came a long
              way! Personally, I first started playing video games because of my
              family. When I would see my cousins at family parties, we would
              gather around the tv and plug-in. Games always varied between
              Mario Party, FIFA street, Mortal Kombat or whatever was trending
              at the time. It was a for all of us to bond. Growing up, I found
              it as a way to stay connected to friends thanks to online gaming.
              Even though I still play video games to stay in touch, I now
              mainly like to play to decompress from life. My favorite games at
              the moment are EA FC 24(FIFA), Rocket League, and Call of Duty.

            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <div class="travel">

              Growing up, traveling never really crossed my mind. The pandemic
              in 2020 delayed those thoughts since it felt like everything was
              shut down. Some time passed and I started thinking about planning
              something out since I saw friends and family go to new places.
              Then, after going on my first official trip to Colombia back in
              2022 I was hooked. It was incredible to see a whole other side of
              the world and witness how different it was. I was lucky that I
              speak Spanish so communication was never an issue and just made
              the trip 10 times better. I plan on traveling and checking out new
              places whenever I get the chance now. Some of my favorite trips so
              far has been to Colombia, Mexico, and Colorado.
